/**
     Given two words (beginWord and endWord), and a dictionary's word list, find the length of shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, such that:
 
     Only one letter can be changed at a time.
     Each transformed word must exist in the word list. Note that beginWord is not a transformed word.
     Note:
 
     Return 0 if there is no such transformation sequence.
     All words have the same length.
     All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
     You may assume no duplicates in the word list.
     You may assume beginWord and endWord are non-empty and are not the same.
 
     Example 1:
 
         Input:
         beginWord = "hit",
         endWord = "cog",
         wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
 
         Output: 5
 
         Explanation: As one shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog",
         return its length 5.
 
     Example 2:
 
         Input:
         beginWord = "hit"
         endWord = "cog"
         wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
 
         Output: 0
 
         Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore no possible transformation.

class WordLadder: Runnable {
    func runTests() {
        let solution = SolutionDualBFS()
        print(solution.ladderLength("hit", "cog", ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]))
    }
    
    /**
        Solution:
    
        The solution to optimize a BFS is to have a pre-cached lookup table on all possibilities of a word pattern.
        For example, *og -> log, cog, dog.
     
        Create a lookup table where we can store the pattern of the string and its associated values.
     
        [
            "*og" -> ["log", "cog", "dog"],
            "l*g" -> ["log"],
            "h*t" -> ["hot"]
            ...
        ]
     
        Now we use BFS by appending the root node "begin word" and a level of 1.
    
        IMPORTANT NOTE:
     
        If we want to keep track of BFS levels, we should probably use a tuple where we have the value and the level of the tree.
        This allows us to pop off the level and increment as needed for child nodes.
     
        Then as we traverse through each child, we look at whether the child value has any adjacent words that share the same
        pattern. If it does, then check if it's the correct word. If it is the correct word, return the level + 1, to include
        the begin word.
     
        If it doesn't match the end word, but passes the pattern, traverse again in DFS and add the next word with level + 1.
     
        OBSERVATION:
     
        The key to this problem is creating a lookup cache to ensure we can look at all surrounding words given a pattern.
        We also need a Visited Set, or Array (which is really part of graph traversal), so we don't scan already visited notes.
     
        Lastly, the reason we can get the min distance is BFS traverses one level at a time. If we can find a solution at that
        level, we know it's the shortest distance. If we were doing DFS, then we'd have to compare the MIN for each traversal,
        if the traversal is even possible.
     
        Performance:
     
        Time Complexity:
            O(N*L) to pattern match for each word, where L is the length of each string.
            O(N) to build the cache. This can be a constant, so O(N) runtime.
            O(N) to search if the end word is not present.
     
        Space Complexity:
            O(N*L) to store the cache, where L is the length of each string.
            O(N) for the queue in the worst case because every word could pop onto the queue.
            O(N) for the visited Set if every word is visited.
