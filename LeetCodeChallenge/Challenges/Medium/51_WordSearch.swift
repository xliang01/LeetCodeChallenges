        Solution:
     
        Use DFS with backtracking to find all permutations of the board, and find the one permutation that creates the word.
        If no permutations exist, return false on all stacks.
     
        Performance:
     
        Time Complexity: O(NM*4^S) Where N is the height of the board, M is the width of the board,
        4 are the directions, and S is the length of the word.
     
        Space Complexity: O(N*M + S) where the first O(NM) is for the DFS visited map. The second O(S) is for the total
        number of recursions that will be popped when matching the word of length S.
