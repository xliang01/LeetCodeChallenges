/*
     You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.
 
     The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".
 
     Example 1:
 
     Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
     Output: 3
 
     Example 2:
 
     Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
     Output: 0
     Note:
 
     S and J will consist of letters and have length at most 50.
     The characters in J are distinct.

         This solution uses ASCII codes to look up valid stones. Since there are only 256 unique ASCII codes,

         than querying the keys of a hash, even though both operations are O(1).
         
         Time Complexity: O(N) - Because you'll have to iterate through all of S.
         Space Complexity: O(1) - Because the ASCII array of 256 items does not change in size.
