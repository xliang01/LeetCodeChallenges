    /**
        Solution:
     
        We must used a controlled recursion. The only way to do this is with a stack. The stack allows us to pop off
        and step by step go through the recursion. Data structure used: Stack to manually traverse stack.
     
        Time complexity:
     
            next()
                O(1) because we always just get the latest value from the stack.
                O(h) on average since we only stack the left children, which is less and less as we traverse the tree.
                O(N) worst case if the tree is lopsided and all left nodes are less than the root.
            hasNext()
                O(1) because we're just checking if the stack is empty.
     
        Space Complexity:
            O(h) because on average, the stack holds at most the height of the tree.
