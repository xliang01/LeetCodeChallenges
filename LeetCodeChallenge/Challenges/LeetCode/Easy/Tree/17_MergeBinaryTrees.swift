/**
    Given two binary trees and imagine that when you put one of them to cover the other, some nodes of the two trees are overlapped while the others are not.
 
    You need to merge them into a new binary tree. The merge rule is that if two nodes overlap, then sum node values up as the new value of the merged node. Otherwise, the NOT null node will be used as the node of new tree.
 
     Input:
         Tree 1                     Tree 2
          1                         2
         / \                       / \
        3   2                     1   3
       /                           \   \
      5                             4   7
 
     Output:
     Merged tree:
         3
        / \
       4   5
      / \   \
     5   4   7

            Test if both nodes exist. If they do, combine the node value and assign to the left tree node.
            This saves memory because we are not creating any new nodes.
         
            If both nodes do not exist, there's nothing to merge. Just return which ever node exists to ensure
            the rest of the tree is retained.
         
            Performance:
         
            Runtime complexity: O(N) If every node can be merged with a trees that have N elements.
            Space complexity: O(1) since no new data structures are used.
         
            Note: Because we are returning direct references from the original tree nodes. Therefore any
            updates to these tree nodes will affect the original.
