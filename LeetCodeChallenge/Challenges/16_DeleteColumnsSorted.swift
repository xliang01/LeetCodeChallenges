            Iterate through all the characters in the string, and ensure each subsequent row at each column
            is greater than the previous row. If not, increment count and break.
         
            Performance:
         
            Time Complexity: O(NM) where N is the number of values, and M is the character count of strings.
            Space Complexity: O(1) since no data structures are used to store additional data.
