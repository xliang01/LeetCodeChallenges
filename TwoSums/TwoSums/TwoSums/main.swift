/*
     Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
     You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
 
     Example:
 
     Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
 
     Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
     return [0, 1].

             Because there is only one solution in the entire array, finding the complement will immediately
             solve the problem.
         
             Edge case: The only issue is when the complement's index is equal to the value of the current index.
             This is NOT the solution because TWO unique indices must be returned. This occurs when the comlement
             is exactly 1/2 times the target value, which means the value is in the hash is equal to the value of
             the current index. Therefore, we must ensure the current index does not equal the hashmap's index.
